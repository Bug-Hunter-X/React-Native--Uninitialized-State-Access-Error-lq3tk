This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when using functional components and the `useState` hook. The `useState` hook returns an array, where the first element is the current state value, and the second is a function to update that value. If you try to access the state value before the component has fully rendered, it will be `undefined` resulting in an error if you try to access properties or methods of that undefined value.

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> {/* Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
